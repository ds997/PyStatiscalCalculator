**Population Mean**

The term population mean, which is the average score of the population on a given variable, is represented by:
```
μ = ( Σ Xi ) / N
```
The symbol ‘μ’ represents the population mean.  The symbol ‘Σ Xi’ represents the sum of all scores present in the population (say, in this case) X1 X2 X3 and so on.  The symbol 
‘N’ represents the total number of individuals or cases in the population.


**Median**

The median of a set of data is the middlemost number in the set. The median is also the number that is halfway into the set. To find the median, the data should first be arranged in order from least to greatest.
If there is an odd number of observations,

For example, consider the list of numbers
```
1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
```
This list contains seven numbers. The median is the fourth of them, which is 6.

If there is an even number of observations,

For example, consider the list of numbers
```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
```
This list contains eight numbers. the median is the mean of the middle two numbers i.e. (4+5)/2 is 4.5.

**Mode**

To find the mode, or modal value, it is best to put the numbers in order. Then count how many of each number. A number that appears most often is the mode.
Example:
```
3, 7, 5, 13, 20, 23, 39, 23, 40, 23, 14, 12, 56, 23, 29
```
In order these numbers are:
```
3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 20, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 39, 40, 56
```
This makes it easy to see which numbers appear most often.
In this case the mode is 23.

**Population Standard Deviation**

Standard deviation measures the spread of a data distribution. It measures the typical distance between each data point and the mean.
Here's the formula again for population standard deviation:
```
σ = ([Σ(x - u)2]/N)1/2
```
Where:
-	σ is the population standard deviation
-	Σ represents the sum or total from 1 to N
-	x is an individual value
-	u is the average of the population
-	N is the total number of the population

**Variance of population proportion**

A population proportion, is a parameter that describes a percentage value associated with a population. A population proportion is usually estimated through an unbiased sample statistic obtained from an observational study or experiment.

**Z-Score**

A Z-score is a numerical measurement used in statistics of a value's relationship to the mean (average) of a group of values, measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. If a Z-score is 0, it indicates that the data point's score is identical to the mean score.
The basic z score formula for a sample is:
```
z = (x – μ) / σ 
```
